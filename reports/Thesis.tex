\begin{abstract}
	
	RR Lyrae are a type of periodic variable star that are often examined due to their utility as distance indicators in space. An effect known as the Oosterhoff Dichotomy has been seen in populations of RR Lyrae stars in globular clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy. This phenomenon is thought to have some importance in learning more about the formation of the Milky Way Galaxy.

\section{RR Lyrae}

RR Lyrae are a type of radially pulsating, periodic variable star that are numerous in Local Group galaxies and examined due to their utility as distance indicators and indicators of early stellar composition. \cite{szczygiel_2009, kinemuchi_2006_a}

RR Lyrae are advanced age stars ($>$ 10 Gyrs) that undergo radial pulsations, whereby they expand and contract in radius over time. \cite{szczygiel_2009} (Szczygiel et al. 2009, ?) These pulsations that RR Lyrae undergo cause the brightness of the star to change over time, with it becoming brighter as it expands and dimmer as it contracts. (?) This change in brightness over time classifies RR Lyrae as variable stars, however unlike some variable stars, RR Lyrae change in brightness at a regular interval, or period, which makes them periodic variable stars. (?, AAVSO)

RR Lyrae are numerous in the Milky Way and other Local Group galaxies and are additionally easy to identify. (Soszyński, 2016, Kinemuchi et al. 2006 (Analysis of ...)) RR Lyrae are often researched due to their use as “standard candles”, or distance indicators. (Soszyński, 2016) The intensity of the luminosity change caused by the periodic pulsations is correlated with the period of the pulsations, thus the period can be used to calculate the luminosity of the star which can be compared with the observed brightness of the star to determine its distance. (?)

\subsection{Light Curves}

When examining variable stars, such as RR Lyrae, we often are working with data on the brightness of the variable star over a given period of time. Sky surveys that gather data on variable stars take photometric brightness measurements of many different variable stars at various different points in time. These brightness measurements over time for a particular variable star are called a light curve. (?)

By examining the light curve of a variable star we can get an idea of the type of brightness variation that the variable star is undergoing. Different types of variable stars tend to have different characteristic patterns of brightness variation. (?)

Light curves are typically plotted as a scatter plot where the x-axis is the time of the observation in Mean Julian Days (MJD) and the y-axis is the brightness of the star in magnitude. (?)

In the case of periodic variable stars, like RR Lyrae, a transformation called period folding is often applied to the light curve to look specifically at the periodic variation that the star undergoes. To period fold a light curve, the time for each brightness measurement is “folded” over the period of the star by taking the remainder of the division of the time by the period to get the “phase” of the observation. \footnote{For non-periodic variable stars, period folding of the light curve is not possible, since the star does not have a variation period to fold the observations over. (?)} (?)

This “period folded light curve” makes it easier to see the pattern of variation that a periodic variable star undergoes, since some periodic variable stars undergo variations that have a higher frequency than the frequency at which the survey observes them. For such periodic variable stars it is difficult to see the variation pattern as each instance of the pattern may have only a few observations. However, when the light curve is period folded, the different instances of the variation pattern line up over one another, making the repeated pattern more apparent. So the low sampling of each instance of the pattern is countered by the high sampling of all of the instances of the pattern as a whole.

\subsection{Properties \& Sub-Types}

RR Lyrae are characterized mainly through a few different properties, both physical and properties of their light curves that develop as a result of physical properties. (?) One of the most commonly examined properties of RR Lyrae is their period, which is the time interval at which they repeat their pulsations and variance in brightness. (?) RR Lyrae typically have periods of 0.2 to 1.2 days. (Szczygiel et al. 2009) For example if an RR Lyrae with a period of 0.58 days reached its peak brightness, at 0.58 days later it would again be at its peak brightness.

[how is period calculated?]

Another commonly examined property is amplitude, or the amount of change that the brightness of the star undergoes as a part of its regular pattern. (?) RR Lyrae typically have amplitudes of 0.2 to 1.6 mag in V-band photometric band light. (Szczygiel et al. 2009) Amplitude is typically calculated by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum measured brightness of the star in magnitudes. (?)

[how is amplitude calculated?]

Another commonly examined property is metallicity, also referred to as [Fe/H], or the ratio of iron to hydrogen in the star. (?) While metallicity can be measured through spectroscopy, for dealing with metallicity for large formations containing RRab estimation forumas are typically used. (?) Some of the metallicity estimation formulas used are from Jurcsik and Kovacs (1996), Sandage (2004), Smolec (2005), and Nemec et al. (2013). (...) \cite{jurcsik_1996, sandage_2004, smolec_2005, nemec_2013} For example, the following formula from Jurcsik and Kovacs (1996) estimates the metallicity of an RRab using its period and $\phi_{31}$. \cite{jurcsik_1996}

$$
[Fe/H] = -5.038 - 5.394 P + 1.345 \phi_{31}
$$

Where $P$ is the period and $\phi_{31}$ is defined as follows.

$$
\phi_{31} = 
$$

Where the $\phi_{n}$ values are the $n$th $\phi$ coefficient of the following fourier fit.

$$
A_{0} + \sum_{k=1}^{m} A_k * cos(2\pi * k * time + \phi_{k})
$$

[metalicity \& estimation formulas]

[plot of RR Lyrae light curve with period and amplitude annotated]

There are several different sub-types of RR Lyrae that tend to have different characteristics due to the mode(s) that they pulsate in. (Chen, 2013) RR Lyrae that pulsate in the fundamental mode are known as RRab. RR Lyrae that pulsate in the first overtone mode are known as as RRc. RR Lyrae that pulsate in both the fundamental and first overtone modes are known as RRd. \footnote{This letter-based naming convention came from ...} \footnote{An additional sub-type of RR Lyrae called RRe, which had second overtone mode pulsations, was thought to exist. However, the existence of RRe has been debated in the literature. (Chen, 2013) For the OGLE IV data release, OGLE has stopped classifying stars as RRe, choosing to group in all stars previously classified as RRe to be RRc, so as to not separate the first and second overtone pulsators. They noted that they did this “because of the doubts whether the RRe stars exist at all”. (Soszyński, 2016)} \footnote{An alternate naming scheme using numbers is sometimes used. In this scheme RRab are called RR0, RRc are called RR1, RRd are called RR01, and RRe are called RR2. This system was introduced in Alcock et al. (2000) in order to allow for easier mnemonic memorization of the different types, with the 0 indicating fundamental mode, 1 indicating first overtone mode, and 2 indicating second overtone mode. (Chen, 2013) I have decided to use the letter-based naming convention instead due to OGLE’s use of it and since it seem to be the more popular naming scheme in the literature.} (Chen, 2013)

These different type of RR Lyrae have different ranges of values for properties like period and amplitude. …. …. ….

\section{Oosterhoff Dichotomy}

In 1939, Pieter Oosterhoff published a paper on some observations he made about RR Lyrae in various globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy. Oosterhoff noticed that if you examined the mean periods of the RRab and RRc in globular clusters, the globular clusters appeared to cluster into two groups. He found that M5 and M3 had lower RRab and RRc periods, while M53, M15, and $\omega$ Cen had higher RRab and RRc periods. \footnote{Globular clusters are typically referred to either by their NGC identifier (like NGC 5024), an M followed by a number (like M53), or a specific name (like ω Cen). (?) See the appendix ... … … … for a list of globular clusters and their various names.} \cite{oosterhoff_1939} These two groups later became known as the Oostherhoff I (OoI) and Oosterhoff II (OoII) groups. (?)

	\label{fig:oosterhoff_1939_globular_clusters}
\end{figure}

While Oosterhoff originally examined globular clusters in terms of the mean and median RRab and RRc periods, research since has looked at other parameters as well in terms of the Oosterhoff dichotomy. (?) ...

However, examinations of globular clusters outside of the Milky Way found some globular clusters that exist in between these two groups, in the Oosterhoff gap. (?) Globular clusters that fell in between the Oosterhoff I and Oosterhoff II groups became known as Oosterhoff intermediate (Oo-Int) globular clusters. (?)

\subsection{Previous fits and clustering of RRab}
There has been some previous research that has looked for fit lines and divisions within the RRab stars in globular clusters that relate to the Oosterhoff dichotomy.

\section{Clustering}

Clustering is the process of looking for patterns groupings of points or patterns in a dataset, typically though the use of automated clustering algorithms. The idea is to find partitions of the data into clusters such that intercluster distance is minimized, or rather the in group similarity should be high. Additionally the intracluster distance should be maximized, or rather the similarity between things in different clusters should be low. \cite{jain_2010}

By applying clustering algorithms to a dataset, we can learn more about sub-categories that exist in the data. \cite{jain_2010}

\subsection{K-Means Clustering}

The clustering algorithm that I used for the data analysis I performed was K-Means clustering. K-Means clustering is an algorithm that takes as input a number of clusters $k$ to try to partition the data into and works by making initial guesses for the $k$ clusters and gradually refining them until a convergence threshold or iteration limit is reached. \footnote{There are other clustering algorithms that do not require the number of clusters to be specified before running the algorithm, some decide the number of clusters on their own based on the data. I choose K-Means because in the use case I had I was reasonably sure the number of clusters would be 2.} \cite{jain_2010}

There are a few different algorithms for K-Means clustering, but one common one is Lloyd’s algorithm. \cite{arthur_2007}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Choose $k$ different random data points for the dataset to be the centers, or ``centroids'', of the clusters.
	\item Until an iteration limit or convergence is reached, repeat the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Assign each point in the dataset to the cluster of the centroid that it is closest to.
		\item For each cluster:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Compute a new ``centroid'' for the cluster by calculating the ``center'' of all of the data points in the cluster. \footnote{Note that this calculated new ``centroid'' point is most often not an actual data point in the dataset, but rather an abstract theoretical point.}
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Calculate the sum squared distances between each data point and its associated centroid.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm works to continually reduce the sum of squared distances of the points within each cluster from their associated centroid, defined by the following equation. \cite{arthur_2007}

$$
\sum_{x \in \chi}^{}\min_{c \in C} || x - c ||^2
$$

Where $\chi$ is the collection of data points, $C$ is the collection of centroids, and $c$ is the centroid closest to the data point $x$.

\subsection{K-Means Implementation used}
For the data analysis, I used the implementation of K-Means clustering in the Scikit-learn Python library. \cite{pedregosa_2011} This implementation uses either Lloyd’s algorithm or Elkan’s algorithm depending on whether the input data is dense or sparse. \cite{scikit_learn_kmeans} Since the data I worked with was dense, Scikit-learn used Elkan’s algorithm.

Elkan’s algorithm is an optimized algorithm for K-Means that makes use of the triangle inequality to avoid unnecessary distance calculations. It works by using the triangle inequality to get upper and lower bounds on the distances between points and centroids to avoid calculating the actual distances, as only the closest centroid to each data point needs to found, so calculating the actual distances is not necessary. \cite{elkan_2003}

\subsection{Kernel functions \& Kernel K-Means}

Kernel functions are transformation functions that can be applied in classification and clustering algorithms, such as support vector machines, to allow for easier classification and clustering of nonlinear patterns. Kernel functions are applied to the input data of an algorithm to transform it from the original feature space into a new feature space in which subgroups within the data are more easily separable. \cite{amari_1999} Kernel functions can also be applied to some clustering algorithms like k-means to achieve clusters of arbitrary shapes. \cite{scholkopf_1998, jain_2010}

Regular k-means clustering cannot separate data into clusters that are not linearly separable. One approach for fitting arbitrary shaped clusters is the use of a kernel function within the k-means algorithm. This technique is referred to as kernel k-means clustering. Kernel k-means clustering works the same as regular k-means clustering, however when performing the distance calculations of a data point from a centroid and determining new centroids, the kernel function is applied to the data points to transform them from the input space to another feature space. \cite{dhillon_2004}

Thus kernel k-means works to iteratively minimize the sum of squared distances of the kernel function transformed data points within each cluster from their associated centroid.

$$
\sum_{x \in \chi}^{}\min_{c \in C} || \phi(x) - c ||^2
$$

Where $\chi$ is the collection of data points, $C$ is the collection of centroids, $\phi$ is the kernel function, and $c$ is the centroid closest to $\phi(x)$.

\section{Data Analysis}

To learn more about the Oosterhoff dichotomy I wanted to try applying clustering algorithms to the fairly recent OGLE IV dataset to see if I could separate the RRab into two clusters that have properties that correspond to the two main Oosterhoff groups.

\subsection{OGLE IV Dataset}

The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) is a long-running photometric survey that has taken CCD observations of the Galactic Bulge and the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds. \cite{udalski_1992, soszynski_2016}

As of the time of writing, the most recent phase of the OGLE survey 

OGLE IV is a dataset that includes data on RR Lyrae present in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. (?) The Large and Small Magellanic clouds, also referred to as the LMC and SMC respectively, are two galaxies in the Local Group that orbit the Milky Way galaxy. (?) They are of particular interest because of their proximity to the Milky Way. (?)

The OGLE IV dataset contains data on a total of 45,451 RR Lyrae, 39,082 in the LMC and 6,369 in the SMC. \cite{soszynski_2016} … (add breakdown by cluster and RR type)

The OGLE IV dataset contains light curves for the RR Lyrae in both I and V photometric bands. The I band light curves are highly sampled over time, while the V band light curves are more sparse. \cite{soszynski_2016}

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{LMC} \\
		\hline
		Band & Num RR Lyrae & Mean \# Observations & Std Dev Observations \\
		\hline
		I & 39,609 & 491 & 216 \\
		V & 37,169 & 100 & 79 \\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{SMC} \\
		\hline
		Band & Num RR Lyrae & Mean \# Observations & Std Dev Observations \\
		\hline
		I & 6,560 & 404 & 150 \\
		V & 6,308 & 37 & 32 \\		
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\captionof{table}{OGLE IV Light Curve Observation Count Summaries}
\end{center}

\subsection{Applying Clustering}
When I was analyzing the data from the OGLE IV dataset I focused on the RRab in particular. This was in part due to the dataset having a larger number of RRab light curves than RRc or RRd. (?)

In working with the OGLE IV data, there were a few parameters of RRab that I was looking at in particular.

…
…
...

I wanted to find a way to separate the RRab population in a way that transfers beyond a particular one of Magellanic clouds

…
…
…

Initially I looked into a few different clustering techniques to see if any of them would be good to try on the data. I tried using K-Means clustering and Spectral Clustering, but neither of these techniques achieved the separation I was looking for.

Looking more closely at the data, I noticed that the groups seemed to follow a trend in period and I band amplitude. Additionally the two groups seemed to be separated by a boundary that follows a similar shape to the trend in the data. So I figured that it would be best to try using a clustering technique that would fit clusters based on a boundary with such a shape.

Many clustering techniques like K-Means clustering tend to fit “blob-like” clusters, so I figured that using such a technique on its own would not be the best approach due to the apparent shape of the groups having a “non-blob” shape.

So I decided to try taking an approach similar to how a kernel function is used, where I would pre-transform the data points into a feature space where clustering algorithms would be able to more easily fit a boundary line of a particular shape.

In order to determine the transformation to apply to the data before using the clustering algorithm, I fit a polynomial trend line to the data. In order to do this, I fit the trendline to only the more densely populated regions, as the more sparse regions caused odd behavior in the trend line.

… … …

With the trend line, I could subtract out the influence line from the data to get a 1 dimensional space, where a boundary value would separate out the original data in a line with the shape of the fitted trend line. Then I was able to apply K-Means clustering to the data to achieve the following clusters.

… … …

\subsection{Analyzing results}
While I was able to apply clustering to determine lines to separate the RRab in the LMC and SMC into subpopulations that seem to relate to the Oosterhoff dichotomy, I wanted to see if these “boundary lines” have a similar effect when applied to the RRab in various globular clusters.

The idea being that if I could apply the boundary line to globular clusters with known Oosterhoff classifications, the ratio of RRab on each side of the boundary line should be related to the Oosterhoff classification of the globular cluster.

To figure this out, I started looking on VizieR and AdsAbs for data releases of RR Lyrae data from globular clusters. \footnote{The VizieR Catalog is an online database of astronomical catalogues which allows for querying and downloading the data of a number of different data releases. \cite{ochsenbein_2000}} \footnote{The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System is a searchable database of papers for fields related to astronomy and astrophysics. \cite{accomazzi_2015}} I recorded each of the relevant data releases that I found into a spreadsheet. I was able to find a total of 41 different data releases. (See section \ref{sec:app_data_releases} \nameref{sec:app_data_releases})

However, I needed to filter down the data releases to the ones that I would be able to use to evaluate my clustering results. Since I was working with period and I-band amplitude I would only be able to work with data releases that had I-band photometry. Out of the 41 data releases I found, 18 had I-band photometry.

I also wanted to only look at globular clusters that had known and agreed upon Oosterhoff classifications, since otherwise I would not be able to evaluate how the boundary line relates to the globular cluster’s Oosterhoff classification. Out of the 18 remaining data releases, 12 were for globular clusters with agreed upon Oosterhoff classifications.

I also wanted to look at different globular clusters, so in the case of having multiple data releases for the same globular cluster I would only use one of the available data releases. With the 12 remaining data releases, there were 8 different globular clusters with data.

I also wanted to look at globular clusters with differing Oosterhoff classifications to get a good idea of how the boundary line relates to the different Oosterhoff classifications. However, of the 8 globular clusters that I had found data releases for 7 of them were OoII and only one was OoI.

Unfortunately only having one OoI globular cluster would not be enough to get a good idea of how the boundary line that I found relates to the Oosterhoff classifications. So I was unable to do this analysis.

This data was collected by looking through papers related to the Oosterhoff dichotomy and looking for mentions of the Oosterhoff classifications of globular clusters in the text of the paper or in tables in the paper. This information was then put into a spreadsheet and filtered down to globular clusters that met the same inclusion criteria as the ``Globular Clusters Summary'' table.

\paragraph{Columns}

\begin{outline}
	\1 Name
	\2 The non-NGC name of the globular cluster. (if any) (ex. M3, M5, M72)
	\1 NGC
	\2 The NGC designation of the globular cluster, or the globular cluster’s name if an NGC designation could not be found. (ex. NGC 5272, NGC 5904, NGC 6121)
	\1 Oost Type
	\2 The Oosterhoff type that the paper suggests that the globular cluster is. (I, II, III, Oo-Int, Oo-Neutral)
	\1 Source
	\2 The paper that suggests the Oosterhoff classification for the globular cluster.
	\1 Notes
	\2 Miscellaneous notes about the particular Oosterhoff type classification.

\subsection{Reproducibility Directions}
All of the code used for the data analysis performed is available at the GitHub repository below.

\vspace{12pt}

\url{https://github.com/ExcaliburZero/rr-lyrae-oosterhoff-clustering}

\vspace{12pt}

The repository includes a Makefile, which can be used to download all of the data from the OGLE website, perform the data analysis, and generate the reports with the results.

\vspace{12pt}

The data analysis scripts were written on an Ubuntu Linux machine, so they should work on all Linux distributions and Mac. However, no guarantee as to whether they will work on a Windows machine.

\vspace{12pt}

The data analysis scripts depend on the following software, so to re-run the analysis you will need to install the following programs.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Pipenv	-	\url{https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}
	\item Pyenv		-	\url{https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv}
\end{itemize}

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can download and run the analysis scripts by running the following terminal commands.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/ExcaliburZero/rr-lyrae-oosterhoff-clustering
pipenv install
make
